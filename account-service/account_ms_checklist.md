1. Database Setup
-  Verify the DATABASE_URL in the .env file is correctly configured. ( changed the name of connection string)
-  Run prisma migrate deploy to apply all database migrations.( pending to do migration)


2. RabbitMQ Enhancements ( to test while actually running )
 - Add retry logic in connectRabbitMQ to handle temporary connection failures.

{
Testing the Retry Logic:
- Scenario 1: Stop the RabbitMQ service, start your application, and observe the retry behavior.
-  Scenario 2: Restart RabbitMQ during a retry attempt to ensure the connection is established once RabbitMQ is available.

}


 - Implement a RabbitMQ health check endpoint to monitor the connection status.
 Log metrics for:
- Messages processed successfully.
- Messages rejected with or without requeue.


3. Consumer Enhancements
-  Validate incoming RabbitMQ message payloads (accountId and newBalance) before processing.
 Add detailed logging for:
- Total messages processed.
- Errors encountered during processing.
-  Implement metrics collection for RabbitMQ message processing (e.g., using Prometheus).


4. Account Service Improvements
Validation
- Ensure Joi schemas are consistent and reusable for all validation.

Error Handling
 - Refine error messages to avoid leaking sensitive information (e.g., Prisma-specific errors).
 - Add specific error codes for better client-side error handling.

Testing
 - Write unit tests for:

- createAccount
- getAccount
- updateBalance

 Write integration tests for database interactions with Prisma.


5. gRPC Server
 - Implement structured logging for gRPC server using tools like winston or pino.
 - Configure gRPC reflection for development and debugging.
 - Ensure secure communication:
- Use TLS for gRPC connections in production.
 - Add health checks for gRPC server (e.g., /healthz endpoint).


6. Containerization
 Add a Dockerfile for the service:
dockerfile
Copy code
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 50051
CMD ["node", "./src/main.js"]

-  Include RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL setup in docker-compose.yaml.
 - Define health checks in docker-compose.yaml for all containers.


7. Monitoring
 - Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection (e.g., message processing, database queries).
 - Set up Grafana for visualizing metrics and logs.
 - Configure alerts for critical issues like RabbitMQ disconnections or database unavailability.


8. Security
 - Use TLS for RabbitMQ and gRPC connections in production.
 - Secure .env file and ensure it is excluded from source control.
 - Implement access control (e.g., IAM roles) for RabbitMQ queues.


9. Documentation
 - Update the account.proto file with detailed descriptions of gRPC methods.
 - Document RabbitMQ message schema for the balance-update queue.
 - Add examples of gRPC requests and responses for:


- CreateAccount
- GetAccount
- UpdateBalance


10. Future Enhancements
 - Add metrics for database query performance.
 - Consider caching frequently requested data (e.g., account balance).
 - Explore batching updates for high-frequency RabbitMQ messages to improve efficiency.


Completion Steps

- Prioritize security and monitoring for production readiness.
- Validate each item on this checklist during or after implementation.
- Continuously test and refine based on logs and feedback.
